### üìã Subscription Management
- Create, read, update, and delete subscriptions
- Support for monthly and yearly subscription frequencies
- Automatic renewal date calculation
- Subscription status tracking (active, inactive, cancelled)
- User-specific subscription access control

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Rate Limiting
- **Arcjet Integration** for advanced security:
  - Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
  - Bot detection and filtering
  - Shield protection against common attacks
  - Configurable security rules

### üìä Data Validation

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Security**: Arcjet (rate limiting, bot detection, shield protection)
- **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs

## Data Models

### User Model
- Name (required, 3-50 characters)
- Email (required, unique, validated format)
- Password (required, minimum 8 characters, hashed)

- User reference (required)

## Security Features

### Arcjet Protection
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 requests per 10 seconds with capacity of 3
- **Bot Detection**: Allows search engines and Postman, blocks malicious bots
- **Shield Protection**: Guards against common web attacks
- **IP-based Characteristics**: Tracks requests by source IP

### Authentication Security
- JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt salt rounds
- Authorization header validation
- User-specific resource access control
